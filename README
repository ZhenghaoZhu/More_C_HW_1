# Homework 1 

The include folder has only one file, fenc.h, which has all the function headers
and #defines used throghout main.c and fenc.c

The src folder has fenc.c which handles password related tasks, reading/writing files, and the
decrypt/encrypt functionality. The decrypt/encrypt code was taken from https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption.

It also contains all the wrapper functions used throghout both .c files.

The testFiles folder contains multiple .txt files which I used in my regression tests to test if 
files were properly saved or copied over to.

The tests folder has three regression tests which test the following: handling of CLI args, error handling of 
erroneous read/write, and hash comparison.

The .gitignore has multiple lines of files I used for testing but didn't include as I thought they were not necessary
for the regression tests.

The Makefile is utilized to compile the program into .o files which are later compiled into an executable. There are lines
specifying what libraries to use during compilation, lssl and lcrypto for example, and there are targets such as clean and 
tests which delete .o files and run tests in the tests folder, respectively.
